# Class 42 - Pythonisms

## [Dunder Methods](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)

* Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types
  * For example, to get the length of a string you can call `len('string')` - but an empty class definition doesn't support this behavior out of the box.

  ```Python
  class ExampleClass:
      pass

  >>> obj = ExampleClass()
  >>> len(obj)
  TypeError: "object of type 'ExampleClass' has no len()"
  ```

  * To fix this, you can add a `__len__` dunder method to your class

  ```Python
  class ExampleClass:
      def __len__(self):
          return 42
  
  >>> obj = ExampleClass()
  >>> len(obj)
  42
  ```

* If you want to write more Pythonic code, knowing how and when to use dunder methods is an important step.

| Use dunder methods for...| Dunder example |
| --- | --- |
| Initialization of new objects | `__init__` |
| Object representation | `__str__`, `__repr__` |
| Enabling iteration | `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__reversed__` |
| Operator overloading (comparison) | `__eq__`, `__lt__` |
| Operator overloading (addition) | `__add__` |
| Method invocation | `__call__` |
| Context manager support (*with* statement) | `__enter__`, `__exit__` |

## [Iterators](https://dbader.org/blog/python-iterators)

* Objects that support the `__iter__` and `__next__` dunder methods automatically work with for-in loops.

* The `__iter__` dunder method:

```Python
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return RepeaterIterator(self)

class RepeaterIterator:
    def __init__(self, source):
        self.source = source
    
    def __next__(self):
        return self.source.value
```

* The RepeaterIterator object we're creating ad returning from the `__iter__` is a helper class we also need to define for our *for-in* iteration to work.
  * In the `RepeaterIterator` class:
    * In the `__init__` method we're linking each `RepeaterIterator` instance to the `Repeater` object that created it. That way we can hold on to the "source" object that's being iterated over
    * In the `__next__` method, we reach back into the "source" `Repeater` instance and return the value associated with it.

## [Generators](https://dbader.org/blog/python-generators)

* Generator functions are syntactic sugar for writing objects that support the iterator protocol.
* Generators abstract away much of the boilerplate code needed when writing class-based editors
* The `yield` statement allows you to temporarily suspend execution of a generator function and to pass values back from it
* Generators start raising `StopIteration` exceptions after control flow leaves the generator function by any means other than a `yield` statement

## [What Are Generators](https://realpython.com/lessons/what-are-python-generators/) Video

* Generators are basically something in Python that produces a sequence of values - integers, strings, floats, booleans, whatever.

* You can call `list()` on a generator to create a list of the yields --> it will call `next()` each iteration remaining
