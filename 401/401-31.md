# Class 31 - Django REST Framework & Docker

## [Beginner's Guide to Docker](https://wsvincent.com/beginners-guide-to-docker/)

* **Docker** is a way to isolate and run entire applications
  * Virtual environments are no longer needed
  * We can reproduce a production environment locally
  * Can be shared among team members so everyone is working on same setup

* Containers vs. Virtual Environments:
  * Virtual environments are used to isolate Python software packages locally.
  * Virtual environments can **only** isolate Python packages
  * Can't run a production database or other services within virtual environments, unlike Docker

### Images & Containers

* Image - snapshot in time of what a project *contains*
* Container - a running instance of the image

* Baking analogy:
  * A `Dockerfile` is the recipe for a cake
  * An *image* is a snapshot of the recipe at a given time
  * A `docker-compose.yml` says how to make the cake
  * The *container* is the actual baked cake

## [Django for APIs - Library Website](https://djangoforapis.com/library-website-and-api/)

* Django REST Framework works alongside Django web framework to create web APIs.
  * Must be added to a project *after* Django has been installed and configured

* Our API will expose a single endpoint that lists out all vooks in JSON.
  * We will need a new URL route, a new view, and a new serializer file

* There are recommendations in here to create a new app for the API! This way you can add new apps in the future and each app can contain the models, views, templates, and urls needed for dedicated webpages, but all API-specific files for the entire project wil live in a dedicated api app.
