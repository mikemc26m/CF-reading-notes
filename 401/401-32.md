# Class 32 - Permissions & Postgresql

## [DRF Permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/)

### Permissions

* Used to grant or deny access for different classes of users to different parts of the API
  * `IsAuthenticated` - REST framework's simplest style - allows any authenticated user access, denies any unauthenticated user.
  * `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` - REST framework's slightly less strict style - allows full access to authenticated users and read-only access to unauthenticated users.

* Permission checks:
  * are always run at the very start of the view, before any other code is allowed to proceed.
  * typically use authentication information in the `request.user` & `request.auth` properties to determine if incoming request should be permitted

### How Permissions Are Determined

* Permissions in REST are always defined as a list of permission **classes**
* Before running main body of the view, each permission in the list is checked.
  * If a permission check fails, raise exception `exceptions.PermissionDenied` or `exceptions.NotAuthenticated`
  * Main body of the view won't run

* When permission checks fail either a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 Unauthorized" response will be returned according to the rules:
  * Request successfully authenticated, but permission denied - *HTTP 403 Forbidden* response returned
  * Request not successfully authenticated, and highest priority authentication class DOES NOT use `WWW-Authenticate` headers - *HTTP 403 Forbidden* response returned
  * Request not successfully authenticated, and highest priority authentication class DOES use `WWW-Authenticate` headers - *HTTP 401 Unauthorized* response returned

### Object Level Permissions

* REST framework permissions support object-level permissioning.
* Object-level permissions used to determine if user should be allowed to act on a particular object - typically a model instance

* Object-level permissions run by REST framework's **generic views** when `.get_object()` is called
  * `exceptions.PermissionDenied` exception raised if user not allowed to act on given object
  * Explicityly call `.check_object_permissions(request, obj)` method on view at point you've retrieved object:
    * To enforce object-level permissions
    * Or if you override the `get_object` method on a generic view

* With the exception of `DjangoObjectPermissions`, the provided permission classes in `rest_framework.permissions` DO NOT implement methods necessary to check object permissions
  * If you wish to use provided permission classes to check object permissions, you MUST subclass them and implement the `has_object_permission()` method
