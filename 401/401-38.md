# Class 38 - React 2

## [**Conditional Rendering**](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

* You can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

## [**Lists & Keys**](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

* You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces.

* Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

* Keys should be given to the elements inside of the array to give the elements a stable identity.

## [**Forms**](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

* HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

## [**Lifting State**](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)

* Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.

## [**Composition vs Inheritance**](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)

* React has a powerful composition model, and it's recommended to use composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.

## [**Thinking In React**](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them.

* Start with a mock
* Break the UI into a component hierarchy
* Build a static version in React
* Identify the minimal (but complete) representation of UI state
* Identify where your state should live
* Add inverse data flow
