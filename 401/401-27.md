# Class 27 - Django Models

## [Using Models](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Models)

**Models** - Python objects Django applications use to access and manage data.

* Models define the structure of stored data
* When designing your models it makes sense to have separate models for every "object" (group of related information)
* Models are usually defined in an application's `models.py` file.
* In every model - minimally - you should define the standard Python class method `__str__()` to return a human-readable string for each object.

* **Multiplicities** - numbers on the diagram showing max/min of each model that may be present in the relationship

**Fields** - A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type.

* Each field represents a column of data we want to store in one of our database tables
* Each database row will consist of one of each field value.

**Common field arguments**:

| Argument | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `help_text` | Provides a text label for HTML forms |
| `verbose_name` | Human-readable name for the field used in field labels. Defaults from field name |
| `default` | Default value for the field. Can be a value or callable object |
| `null` | If `True`, Django will store blank values as `NULL` in the database for fields where this is appropriate. The default is `False` |
| `blank` | If `True`, the field is allowed to be blank. Default is `False` |
| `choices` | Group of choices for this field |
| `primary_key` | If `True`, sets the current field as the primary key for the model. (A primary key is a special database column designated to uniquely identify all the diffferent table records) |

**Common field types**:

| Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `CharField` | used to define short-to-mid sized fixed-length strings. You must specify the `max_length` of the data to be stored |
| `TextField` | used for large arbitrary-length strings |
| `IntegerField` | field for storing integer (whole number) values, and validating entered values as integers |
| `DataField` & `DateTimeField` | used for storing/representing dates and date/time information |
| `EmailField` | used to store and validate email addresses |
| `FileField` & `ImageField` | used to upload files and images |
| `AutoField` | special type of `IntegerField` that automatically increments. |
| `ForeignKey` | Used to specify a one-to-many relationship to another database model |
| `ManyToManyField` | Used to specify a many-to-many relationship |

## [Django Admin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Admin_site)

The Django admin application automatically builds an area on your site where you can create, view, update and delete records. Makes it easy to test your models and get a feel for whether you have the right data.

* Admin application can be useful for managing data in production

* All you must do to add your models to the admin application is to **register** them.

**Superuser**:

* A user account with *Staff* status enabled.
* Has permissions to manage all the objects
* Full access to the site and all needed permissions using `manage.py`

In terminal, run `python manage.py createsuperuser`

* Will prompt you to enter a username, email address, and *strong* password.
* Restart the development server and test the login.
