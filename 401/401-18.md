# Class 18 - Cryptography

## [Encryption, Decryption & Hacking](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:online-data-security/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:data-encryption-techniques/a/encryption-decryption-and-code-cracking)

There are 3 main techniques for cracking a cipher without knowing the shift:

* Frequency Analysis
* Known plaintext
* Brute force

Frequency Analysis:

* Human languages tend to use some letters more than others. ("E" is the most popular letter in the English language.)

Known Plaintext:

* Another term for the original unencrypted message

**Three key aspects of data encryption**:

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Encryption | Scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift) |
| Decryption | Recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key. |
| Code cracking | Uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques |

We need to think about...

* How easy is it to encrypt?
* How easy is it to decrypt?
* And most importantly - how easy is it for a nefarious individual to crack the code?

## [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

* Named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

* Also known as **Caesar's cipher**, the **shift cipher**, **Caesar's code**, or **Caesar shift**

* One of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques

* The Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.

There's no such thing as a 100% secure computer system. There will always be bugs.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Defensive Depth | A strategy which uses many layers of varying security mechanisms to frustrate attackers. |
| Cipher | An algorithm that converts plain text into ciphertext |
| Encryption | Make it secret |
| Decryption | Reverse of encryption (decoding) |
| Substitution Ciphers | Replace every letter in a message with something else according to a translation |
| Permutation ciphers | New letter ordering |
| Data Encryption Standard (DES) |- Developed by IBM and the NSA in 1977, originally used binary keys that were 56 bits long (2^56 - 72 quadrillion - different keys)|
| Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) | Published in 2001, designed to use much bigger keys: 128, 192, or 256 bits in size, making brute force attacks harder. AES balances performance and security to provide practical cryptography  |
| Key Exchange | An algorithm that lets two computers agree on a key without ever sending one |
| Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange | One-way function is modular exponentiation: the base, the exponent, the modulus |
| Symmetric keys | Key is the same on both sides |
| Asymmetric encryption | 2 different keys, most often one that's public and another that's private. |
| RSA | Most popular asymmetric encryption technique, named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir and Adleman |

The padlock icon means your computer has used:

* *public key cryptography* to verify the server
* *key exchange* to establish a secret temporary key
* *symmetric encryption* to protect all the back-and-forth communication

## [Introduction to Cryptography](https://thebestvpn.com/cryptography/)

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Cryptography | The art and science of encrypting sensitive information |
| Polymorphism | Basically, a cipher that changes itself with each use |
| Obfuscation | The act of making something unclear, obscure, or unintelligible |

Four types of cryptography:

* **Hashing**
  * Changes a message into an unreadable string of text for the purpose of verifying the message's contents, *not* hiding the message.
  * Most commonly used to protect transmission of software and large files
  * Currently, most common hashing algorithms are **MD5** and **SHA-1* but most applications are transitioning to the **SHA-256** algorithm.

* **Symmetric cryptography**
  * Likely the most traditional form of cryptography
  * Primary application is protection of resting data (e.g. Hard Drives and data bases)
  * Uses a single key to encrypt a message then decrypt message upon delivery
  * Requires secure channel for delivering crypto key

* **Asymmetric Cryptography**
  * Used when transmitting email files, remotely connecting to servers, digitally signing PDF files
  * URL beginning with "https://" --> example of asymmetric cryptography keeping your info safe
  * Uses two different keys for encryption and decryption
    * First key is a public key used to encrypt message
    * Second key is a private key used to decrypt message

* **Key exchange algorithms**
  * Used to safely exchange encryption keys with an unknown party
  * You're not sharing information during key exchange
  * The end goal is to create an encryption key with another party that can later be used with other forms of cryptography

The 4 types of Cryptographic Functions

1. Authentication
2. Nonrepudiation
3. Confidentiality
4. Integrity

## [How Computers Generate Random Numbers](https://www.howtogeek.com/183051/htg-explains-how-computers-generate-random-numbers/)

There are two categories of random numbers:

* **True** random numbers
* **Pseudorandom** numbers
