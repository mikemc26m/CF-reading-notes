## Ethics In The Workplace Article: The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of

The ethical issue of this article shines a light on the idea of paying attention to what you're contributing to. While the author feels guilty for coding "something that was basically designed to trick young girls" - he was also young, and had multiple people above him that also could have stopped to think something might be wrong with this project. The Account Manager who got the requirements from the client, the Project Manager who realized all the quiz recommendations pointed to the client's drug, these people also didn't stop to say "Hold on a minute, what?" I feel like this highlights the need to make sure to really understand what it is you're doing, and think about the results of your work. Is this something you think is right? I imagine in this line of work it can get to the point where you're given a task and you get it done, but at the end of the day, you have to have the responsibility to be aware of what you're contributing to.

## Ethics In Technology Article: Cyber-Security of Self-Driving Cars

"In principle, any computerized system that has an interface to the outside world is potentially hackable." BOOM! Think of all the times your technology hasn't worked the way it's supposed to. Your computer crashing, your gaming consoles freezing or bugging, your phones, etc. It's kind of scary to think of the potential ways your car could run into the same kind of issues where the tech doesn't work the way it's supposed to. But then you throw in security invulnerabilities on top of that? The team of researchers that demonstrated activating the car's brakes while driving. Having your car hijacked. Cars have mechanical malfunctions and cars get stolen already, but having extra measures built in that could possibly end up as new ways to invite bad actors into the mix just spooks me.
