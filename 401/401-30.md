# Class 30 - Hash Tables

## [Intro to Hash Tables](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-30/resources/Hashtables.html)

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Hash | The result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array. |
| Buckets | What is contained in each index of the array of a hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs. |
| Collisions | What happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable |

**Why do we use hashtables**?

* To hold unique values
* Dictionary
* Library

**What are they**?

* A data structure that utilizes key/value pairs.
* Every node - or bucket - has both a key and a value.

Basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure and quickly retrieve the value. This is done through a `hash`.

* Basically a hash code turns a key into an integer.
* Hash codes should never have randomness to them. The ame key should always produce the same hash code.

**Creating a hash** --

Traditionally created from an array.

* Add or multiply all the ASCII values together
* Multiply it by a prime number such as 599
* Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array
* Insert into the array at that index

Example:

```Python
Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280
280 * 599 = 69648
69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16
```
