* Context is broken into 2 sections:
  * Context provider - you want to wrap all the code that needs access to the information IN the context
  * Single prop called VALUE - whatever the value of your context is

* IMPORTANT: Everything inside of our provider all have access to the variable in the VALUE prop
  * Context is for passing down props into all the children without having to manually pass information through the props
  * Kind of like a global state for all of the children of the provider

* Use a hook to import to a Function Component - `import {useContext}`
